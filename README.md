## Implementations

The `implementations-expriments/` directory contains code implementations of various machine learning papers, such as GPT. These implementations serve as practical examples to help understand and reproduce the techniques described in the papers.

## Experiments

This section (also in `implementations-expriments/`) showcases experiments conducted using different machine learning techniques. For instance, you can find an experiment on training a small transformer on the `tinystories` dataset (WIP). These experiments provide insights into the application of machine learning algorithms to real-world problems.

## Library Examples

In this section, you'll find examples demonstrating the usage of popular machine learning libraries. From training a huggingface tokenizer to improved PyTorch documentation, these examples aim to help you effectively utilize these libraries in your own projects.
